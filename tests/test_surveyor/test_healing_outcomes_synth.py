"""healing_outcomes synthesis + non-aggressive parent_run_id NULL (1.1.0).

Covers TEST_MANIFEST.md ⏳ items under "healing_outcomes.parent_run_id" that
aren't already covered by test_aggressive_telemetry.py:

  * Non-aggressive paths leave `parent_run_id` NULL on healing_outcomes.
  * When the unified loop exits with `patch=None`, CLI synthesises one
    healing_outcomes row per attempt_records entry with patch_applied=false,
    failure_category derived from the attempt signature.
  * `aqueduct run` final status line + on_success webhook payload report the
    outer run_id, not the inner iteration uuid.
